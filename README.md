## Distributed Systems
In the context of the Distributed Systems class, my work group built a command line client and server applications to manage rented scooters within a specific delimited perimeter. This project involved using multiple threads in Java, to allow several clients to request and use scooters si- multaneously. Through this work, I learned thread management, how to handle synchronization, thread safety, and proper resource management to avoid issues like data inconsistency, deadlocks, or resource contention- cription.
